# WatchHub Add-on for Stremio
This Add-on allows Stremio to find a movie/tv episode from many streaming services, including Netflix, Hulu and iTunes.
Currently it selects a source in this priority: free, tv everywhere, purchase, subscription.

When Stremio allows settings for Add-ons, you would be able to select which of these types to pick first, or even a particular service (e.g. Netflix) which to pick first.

## Regions
Currently US and UK supported - will be able to set that up manually through Stremio Add-on settings.

Guidebox has launched internationally so support in this add-on is on the agenda.
